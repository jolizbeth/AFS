    AFS (Ad Filtration System)
Idea / Concluding thought pre-presentation:
A browser extension
Registration / Login for existing AT&T (mobile, DirecTV, HBO, HBOMax) users via email
Users choose categories->preferred brand of ads that they would like to see
All ad preferences are saved in user profile and editable
Users can also choose to set a time limit for categories
Users have a “Giving” folder to select preferred nonprofits/charity
Ad companies get:
Keep track of # of clicks
# of saves of their ads
# of interest in their categories
X% dedicated to a nonprofit/charity (selected by users who click on their ads, from their “giving” folder)
E.g.: Jane clicks on an ad for Nike, x% of the profit for clicking that ad goes to a nonprofit/charity inside the Jane’s “giving” folder
Publishers can get more engaged users when users are given the option to bookmark the ads
BRAINSTORM: 
Ad filtering system: App / Browser extensions
For Consumers
chooses the exact type of ads
Have a time limit for each category
“Bookmark”-ing an app 
a reminder of the ad when leaving a site/the app
A notification to stop you from closing/switching the tab
Save for later (Coupon wallet)
A folder option
Save ad preferences in a user profile
Do not disturb
By category
Example: consumer wants to buy baby gifts within 1-2 months, relevant ads will only show for this 1-2 months
Only ads relevant to the site you’re on


For Publishers / people who need/want ads on their site
(Already exist feature) decide the categories that they want to allow in their site


For Advertising companies
Categorize themselves?
Categorize their products
Ex: shoes, baby products, etc
Watch ads to earn points that convert into donation for a charity (by Niranjan Jadhav)
What user needs to do
1.     Create a website where users can register for this
2.     Existing AT&T (mobile, DirecTV, HBO, HBOMax) users can use their account number, email id to sign in (this will allow us to understand user likings based on their interaction with these AT&T services)
3.     Select what type of products users are more interested in from a predefined list
a.     Make user segments based on their choices for targeted ads using existing Xandr Data pipelines
4.     Watch ads on the AT&T TV Now, HBO Max, or on the website we created.
5.     Keep track of earned rewards on the website
6.     Donate the reward (converted to Dollar amount) to a charity.

Future Ideas: 
An app with login to control all other ads in other apps
