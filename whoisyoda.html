  <center><h1>Who is Baby Yoda?</h1></center>
  <p>
	  Yoda is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. He is a small, green humanoid alien with tremendous power in the Force. In his first appearance in the original trilogy, the spirit of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi describes Yoda as the Jedi master who trained him and asks Luke Skywalker to seek Jedi training from Yoda, which Luke does and later uses to fight against the Galactic Empire. The character reappears in Return of the Jedi where he reveals his age to be 900, making him the oldest living character in the Star Wars franchise.

	  In the prequel trilogy, set a generation before the original trilogy, Yoda is among the most powerful members of the Jedi Order and a general of clone troopers during the Clone Wars. Yoda also trains all Jedi children, before they are assigned a Jedi master.

	  Two other members of Yoda's unnamed alien species are known, although neither is known to be part of Yoda's family. Yaddle (who appears as a background female character in the prequel trilogy film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as a Jedi master) and the character in The Mandalorian known currently as "The Child" (initially called Baby Yoda by fans). Very little is known about Yoda's alien species, though all three are powerful in The Force.
